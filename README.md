# MusicHub

## Description:

### This web application is meant to be a hub where music fans are able to see their favourite artists featured and vote for them based on the content we shared, that would include; their music, artist photo, the quality of their social media and more! MusicHub is meant to be interactive and a one stop shop where, if the fans like what the artist is doing and the direction they are going in, they are able to look at the ticket master portion of the site and see if the artists are touring at a city near them! MusicHub is as much for the artist as it is for the fans, the artist benefit would be an increase in music streaming and concert sales due the hype that would surround them, and for the fan, the biggest benefit would be having a community where their are able to be apart of the music scene.
